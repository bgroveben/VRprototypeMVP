Prototype for VeteranReady site MVP. I am using Bootstrap v3.3.4, Font Awesome 4.2.0, and jQuery v1.11.1.

The purpose of this site is to show a polished draft of what the Veteran Ready site will look like, so I am not worried about the functionality just yet.

Rather than starting from scratch, I am going to work off of a template that I found at http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/modern-business/.
Therefore, I am leaving in the following legalese:
